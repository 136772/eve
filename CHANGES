Eve Changelog
=============

Here you can see the full list of changes between each Eve release.

Version 0.0.3
-------------

Not yet released.

- Streamlined JSON responses. 
  The superflous ``response`` root key has been removed from JSON payloads. In
  order to properly validate, XML payloads will still carry a ``response`` root
  node.

  GET requests to resource endpoints. Items are always wrapped in
  an ``items`` list. Previously the list name would match the name of the
  resource being accessed.  
  
  GET requests to item endpoints. The item key is always set to ``item``.
  Previously it would match the resource name minus the final 's'.

- Support for API versioning through the new API_VERSION configuration setting.
- Boolean values in request forms are now correctly parsed.
- Tests now run under Python 2.6.


Version 0.0.2
-------------

Released on November 27th 2012.

- Homepage/api entry point resource links fixed. They had bad 'href'
  tags which also caused XML validation issues when processing responses
  (especially when accessing the API via browser).

- Version number in 'Server' response headers.

- Added support for DELETE at resource endpoints. Expected behavior:
  will delete all items in the collection. Disabled by default.

- :class:`eve.io.mongo.Validator` now supports :class:`~cerberus.Validator`
  signature, allowing for further subclassing.

Version 0.0.1
-------------

Released on November 20th 2012.

- First public preview release.
