RESTful APIs Made Simple
========================

Eve allows to effortlessly build and deploy fully featured, REST-compliant, proprietary APIs. 

Eve is Simple
-------------
.. code-block:: python

    from eve import Eve

    app = Eve() 
    app.run()

The API is now live, ready to be consumed:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://example.com/people/
    
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ...

All you need to bring your API online are a database, a configuration file
(defaults to ``settings.py``), and a launch script such as the one above.
Overall, you will find that configuring and fine-tuning your API is a very
simple process.  

Features
--------
- REST compliant
- Full range of CRUD operations via HTTP verbs
- Customizable resource endpoints/persistent identifiers
- Multiple item endpoints
- Filtering
- Sorting
- Python native query syntax (``?where=name=='john doe'``)
- Alternative MongoDB query syntax (``where={"name": "john doe"}``)
- Pagination
- HATEOAS (Hypermedia as Engine of Application State)
- JSON and XML responses
- Conditional requests (``Last-Modified`` and ``ETag`` headers)
- Data integrity and concurrency control
- Multiple inserts with a single request
- Data validation
- Resource-level cache control directives
- API Versioning
- CORS 

Live demo
---------
Check out the `live demo`_ (if using a browser you will get XML back.
For JSON, use ``curl``). Check the `source code`_ to get an idea of what you
can achieve with Eve. You will also find `usage examples`_ for all common use
cases (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, and more). There is also a simple `client
app`_ available.
