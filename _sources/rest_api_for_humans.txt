REST API for Humans
===================
I have been giving this talk to several conferences and meetups. A few people
suggested that I post the talk slides on the Eve website, so here it is: a quick
rundown on Eve features, along with a few code snippets and examples. Hopefully
it will do a good job in letting you decide wether Eve is valid solution for
your use case.
