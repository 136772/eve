Full featured REST API designed to be easily customizable. Supports MongoDB out of the box and extensions for other SQL/NoSQL databases are easily implemented. While you wait for the actual code (duh), to get an idea of upcoming features, please check out the following EuroPython 2012 presentation:

[Developing RESTful Web APIs with Python, Flask and MongoDB](https://speakerdeck.com/u/nicola/p/developing-restful-web-apis-with-python-flask-and-mongodb)

*Please note*: while the general approach and feature-set remains valid, implementation details have changed since then.
